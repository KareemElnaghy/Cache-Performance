# Cache-Performance

Welcome to our Cache Memory Simulator project! We are developing a set associative cache simulator in C/C++ to explore the impact of various cache parameters on performance. With a fixed cache size of 64 Kbytes, variable cache line sizes from 16 to 128 bytes, and configurable ways ranging from 1 to 32, our simulator aims to provide valuable insights into cache behavior within a 64 Mbyte memory address space. This project is currently in progress, and we look forward to discovering how different configurations affect cache efficiency.
